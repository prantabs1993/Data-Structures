Mutability:\n","Definition: Mutable objects allow their internal data to be modified after creation.\n","Examples: Lists, dictionaries, and sets are mutable in Python.\n","List:\n","Python\n","\n","\n","        my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","        my_list.append(4)  # Modifying the list\n","        print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","Dictionary.\n","Python\n","\n","\n","        my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2}\n","        my_dict[\"c\"] = 3  # Modifying the dictionary\n","        print(my_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n","set.\n","Python\n","\n","\n","        my_set = {1, 2}\n","        my_set.add(3)  # Modifying the set\n","        print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}\n","Immutability:\n","Definition: Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation; any modification results in a new object being created.\n","Examples: Strings, tuples, and frozen sets are immutable in Python.\n","String:\n","Python\n","\n","\n","        my_string = \"hello\"\n","        # my_string[0] = 'H'  # This will raise an error because strings are immutable\n","        new_string = my_string.replace(\"h\", \"H\") # Creates a new string\n","        print(new_string) # Output: \"Hello\"\n","        print(my_string) # Output: \"hello\"\n","tuple.\n","Python\n","\n","\n","        my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","        # my_tuple[0] = 4  # This will raise an error because tuples are immutable\n","        new_tuple = my_tuple[:1] + (4,) + my_tuple[2:] # Creates a new tuple\n","        print(new_tuple) # Output: (1, 4, 3)\n","frozen set.\n","Python\n","\n","\n","        my_frozen_set = frozenset({1, 2})\n","        # my_frozen_set.add(3) # This will raise an error because frozen sets are immutable'''\n","\n","\n","\n","   '''Q.What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","     Ans. Tuples are immutable objects and lists are mutable objects. Once defined, tuples have a fixed length and lists\n","      have a dynamic length. Tuples use less memory and are faster to access than to lists. Tuple syntax uses round brackets\n","       or parenthesis, and list syntax uses square brackets.'''\n","\n","\n","       '''Q.Describe how dictionaries store data?\n","       Ans. Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*,\n","        changeable and do not allow duplicates. As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier,\n","         dictionaries are unordered.'''\n","\n","\n","\n","         '''Q. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","         Ans.Because sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element, it makes sets highly useful to efficiently\n","          remove duplicate values from a list or tuple and to perform common math operations like unions and intersections.'''\n","\n","\n","\n","          '''Q.  What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","           Ans. 1)  Strings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes ('' or “”). Lists are ordered collections of items enclosed in square brackets [].\n","            2) Strings are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created, while lists are mutable and can be modified as needed.\n","\n","\n","            Q.  How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","            Ans. Once created, tuples cannot be modified, which can prevent accidental changes to data. This feature is particularly\n","             useful when you want to ensure the integrity of your data.\n","\n","\n","             Q. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python3\n","             Ans.A hash table is a data structure that offers an efficient way to organize data for quick access. A key is transformed into an\n","             index (a process known as hashing) of an array element where the corresponding\n","              value is stored. This process allows for average-time complexity of O(1) for lookups, insertions, and deletions, making hash tables\n","               extremely efficient.\n","\n","               Differences Between Python Dictionaries and Hash Tables:\n","Abstraction Level: Python dictionaries are a high-level abstraction of hash tables. While you interact directly with dictionaries in Python, hash tables\n","are often used behind the scenes to implement dictionaries in many programming languages, including Python.\n","Data Structure Type: In Python, dictionaries are recognized as a built-in data type, while hash tables are generally a concept used in the implementation\n"," of dictionaries and other data structures.\n","Usage: Dictionaries in Python are used directly in programs to handle data. In contrast, hash tables are usually more of a theoretical model for how\n","dictionaries could be implemented to ensure maximum efficiency.\n","\n","               Similarities Between Python Dictionaries and Hash Tables\n","Key-Value Storage: Both structures store data in key-value pairs, where each key is unique.\n","Efficiency: Both are designed to allow for quick data retrieval. Hash tables achieve this through hashing, and Python dictionaries are optimized for\n","quick lookup by using a similar hashing mechanism.\n","Dynamic Resizing: Many implementations of hash tables and Python dictionaries resize dynamically. This resizing is\n","crucial to maintain operations’ efficiency as the number of elements grows.\n","\n","\n","Q. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","Ans. A list in Python CAN contain different types of data. Each item in the list is separated by a comma and the entire list is\n"," enclosed in square brackets [] .\n"," To add a new item to the list, just edit the list starting before the closing bracket.\n","\n","\n"," Q. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n"," Ans. Strings in Python are “immutable” which means they can not be changed after they are created. Some other immutable data types are integers,\n"," float, boolean, etc. The immutability of Python string is very useful as it helps in hashing, performance optimization, safety, ease of use, etc.\n","\n"," Q.What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n"," Ans. Dictionaries excel over lists for tasks involving fast lookups by keys (instead of index) and storing data in a structured, key-value format. They are unordered, making them suitable when order is not important and quick retrieval based on a specific identifier is needed.\n","Here's a more detailed breakdown:\n","Key-Value Storage:\n","Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, allowing you to access values using unique keys, which can be any immutable data type (like strings, numbers, or tuples).\n","Efficient Lookups:\n","Unlike lists, which require iterating through elements to find a specific value, dictionaries use a hash table to provide near-instantaneous access to values based on their keys.\n","Unordered Nature:\n","Dictionaries are unordered collections, meaning the order of elements is not guaranteed or relevant. This makes them ideal for tasks where order is not a requirement, such as storing configurations or caches.\n","When to Use Dictionaries:\n","When you need to store data where you can associate a value with a specific identifier (key).\n","When fast lookups based on keys are essential.\n","When the order of the data is not important.\n","For tasks like creating lookup tables, storing configurations, or implementing caches.\n","When to Use Lists:\n","When you need to store an ordered sequence of items.\n","When you need to perform operations that rely on the order of elements (e.g., stacks, queues).\n","When you need to access elements by their position (index).\n","Example:\n","Imagine storing student data. A list could store a list of tuples (name, ID, grade), but a dictionary could store data using the ID as the key and a dictionary of name and grade as the value. Dictionaries allow for quick access to a student's information by their ID.\n","\n","Q.Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","Ans.When we want to ensure that data is not changed accidentally. Tuples being immutable do not allow any changes in its data.\n","When we want faster access to data that will not change as tuples are faster than lists.\n","When we want to use the data as a key in a dictionary. Tuples can be used as keys in a dictionary, but lists cannot.\n","When we want to use the data as an element of a set. Tuples can be used as elements of a set, but lists cannot.\n","\n","Q.How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","Ans.Duplicate values will be ignored by Python in sets.\n","\n","Q. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","Ans. The 'in' operator or keyword works by accessing the i-1 index in a string while in a dictionary, it accesses the key value in a key-value pair.\n","\n","\n","Q.Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n","Ans.Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that you cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created.\n","\n","But there are some workarounds.\n","\n","Change Tuple Values\n","Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.\n","\n","But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.\n","\n","ExampleGet your own Python Server\n","Convert the tuple into a list to be able to change it:\n","\n","x = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n","y = list(x)\n","y[1] = \"kiwi\"\n","x = tuple(y)\n","\n","print(x)\n","Add Items\n","Since tuples are immutable, they do not have a built-in append() method, but there are other ways to add items to a tuple.\n","\n","1. Convert into a list: Just like the workaround for changing a tuple, you can convert it into a list, add your item(s), and convert it back into a tuple.\n","\n","Example\n","Convert the tuple into a list, add \"orange\", and convert it back into a tuple:\n","\n","thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n","y = list(thistuple)\n","y.append(\"orange\")\n","thistuple = tuple(y)\n","2. Add tuple to a tuple. You are allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you want to add one item, (or many), create a new tuple with the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple:\n","\n","Example\n","Create a new tuple with the value \"orange\", and add that tuple:\n","\n","thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n","y = (\"orange\",)\n","thistuple += y\n","\n","print(thistuple)\n","Note: When creating a tuple with only one item, remember to include a comma after the item, otherwise it will not be identified as a tuple.\n","\n","ADVERTISEMENT\n","\n","Remove Items\n","Note: You cannot remove items in a tuple.\n","\n","Tuples are unchangeable, so you cannot remove items from it, but you can use the same workaround as we used for changing and adding tuple items:\n","\n","Example\n","Convert the tuple into a list, remove \"apple\", and convert it back into a tuple:\n","\n","thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n","y = list(thistuple)\n","y.remove(\"apple\")\n","thistuple = tuple(y)\n","Or you can delete the tuple completely:\n","\n","Example\n","The del keyword can delete the tuple completely:\n","\n","thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n","del thistuple\n","print(thistuple) #this will raise an error because the tuple no longer exists.\n","\n","\n","Q. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","Ans. A nested dictionary in Python is a dictionary where the values are themselves dictionaries,\n","allowing for hierarchical data organization. A use case is storing employee records, .\n","where each employee's details, including their department and job title, are organized within a nested dictionary\n","Example:\n","# Nested dictionary representing employee records\n","employees = {\n","    \"department1\": {\n","        \"employee1\": {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"job_title\": \"Engineer\"},\n","        \"employee2\": {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"job_title\": \"Manager\"}\n","    },\n","    \"department2\": {\n","        \"employee3\": {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"job_title\": \"Analyst\"},\n","        \"employee4\": {\"name\": \"David\", \"job_title\": \"Developer\"}\n","    }\n","}\n","\n","# Accessing specific employee information\n","print(employees[\"department1\"][\"employee1\"][\"name\"])  # Output: Alice\n","print(employees[\"department2\"][\"employee3\"][\"job_title\"]) # Output: Analyst\n","\n","\n","Q.  Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionaryP\n","Ans. The time complexity of retrieving a value by its key in a dictionary is O(1). This is because dictionaries use a hash table internally\n"," which allows constant time lookup. Why O(1)? Hash tables use the hash of the key to find the memory location which enables direct access.\n","\n","Q. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","Ans. Lists are often preferred over dictionaries when maintaining order is crucial,\n"," and when operations like appending or extending are frequent, while dictionaries are better for quick lookups based on key.\n","\n","\n","Q.Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","Ans.Dictionaries are considered unordered because they are designed for fast key-based retrieval rather than maintaining a specific order of elements. This means\n","that when you iterate or access elements, the order might not match the insertion order, and you cannot access elements using an index like in lists.\n","\n","\n","Q. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","Ans.In data retrieval, lists access elements by their numerical index (starting from 0), while dictionaries access elements (values)\n"," by their unique key, offering faster lookups for large datasets.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Practical Questions\n","# 1.Write a code to create a string with your name and print it.\n","name = 'Pranjal Banerjee'\n","print(name)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ie6lkasEDiXM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742141283300,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":26,"user":{"displayName":"Pranjal Banerjee","userId":"02073936127818861002"}},"outputId":"0dc7224a-c464-42b3-ea24-c7eee9f245e0"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Pranjal Banerjee\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n"],"metadata":{"id":"kV6q-V2GBZZu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2.
